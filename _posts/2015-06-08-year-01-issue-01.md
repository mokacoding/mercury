Welcome to the very first issue of the **The iOS Times**, a weekly publication with new and trending projects in the open source iOS ecosystem, brought to you by [mokacoding.com](http://mokacoding.com).

**The iOS Times** doesn't want to replace other weekly publications like [iOS Dev Weekly](https://iosdevweekly.com/) or [iOS Goodies](http://ios-goodies.com/), but rather complement them with a deeper focus _on the code and on the tools_.

Never before the Open Source community in the iOS, and Mac, ecosystem has been as active and vibrant, and we feel getting exposure to new projects is a great way to find useful tools, learn something new, or even get involved in the community.

Thanks for reading, I hope you'll enjoy.<br/>[_-Gio_](http://twitter.com/mokagio)

# Trending Swift projects

### [EasyAnimation](https://github.com/icanzilb/EasyAnimation) 

Neat framework to write cleaner animation code, from this

```swift
let anim = CABasicAnimation(keyPath: "position.x")
anim.fromValue = 100.0
anim.toValue = 200.0
anim.duration = 2.0
anim.fillMode = kCAFillModeBackwards
anim.beginTime = CACurrentMediaTime() + 2.0
anim.timingFunction = CAMediaTimingFunction(name: kCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseOut)
anim.repeatCount = Float.infinity
anim.autoreverses = true
view.layer.addAnimation(anim, forKey: nil)
```

to this

```swift
UIView.animateWithDuration(2.0, delay: 2.0, 
  options: .Repeat | .Autoreverse | .CurveEaseOut, 
  animations: {
    self.view.layer.position.x += 200.0
    }, 
  completion: nil)
```

### [RubberBandEffect](https://github.com/Produkt/RubberBandEffect) 

Small project showing 3 different mathematical functions to achieve Appleâ€™s rubber band effect in Swift.

### [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) and [SwiftCov](https://github.com/realm/SwiftCov) 

The folks at [Realm](https://realm.io/) bring us two tools to generate lint warnings and test coverage for Swift projects. Even if you don't see yourself using them, it's worth having a look as they're written in Swift.

If you are interested in taking a more functional approach in your Swift code -and [you should](http://2014.funswiftconf.com/speakers/andy.html)- then have a look at [**Future**](https://github.com/nghialv/Future) and [**Argo**](https://github.com/thoughtbot/Argo), which have both gained interest this week.

# New Swift projects

### [DynamicColor](https://github.com/yannickl/DynamicColor) 

`UIColor` extension to get new instances by changing lightness, darkness, saturation, etc.

Nothing else particularly exciting has been released this week, but [ExpandingTableView](https://github.com/jozsef-vesza/ExpandingTableView), "a _framework_ for expanding table view cells", and [OZSwiftPlayButton](https://github.com/otaviokz/OZSwiftPlayButton), an animated play/pause button, still deserve to be mentioned.

# New Objective-C projects

### [DownloadButton](https://github.com/PavelKatunin/DownloadButton)

Configurable replica of the App Store download button. One thing to notice, its `IB_DESIGNABLE` and `IB_INSPECTABLE`.

### [WZDraggableSwitchHeaderView](https://github.com/wongzigii/WZDraggableSwitchHeaderView)

Navigate through app's screens by dragging down the screen to reveal a secret menu.

_This is certainly an interesting and original take at the navigation, but how nice would it look with a UI different from the example one?_

### [Aardvark](https://github.com/square/Aardvark)

Bug reporter library made by [Square](http://square.github.io/). 

> [..] your users can report a bug by making a two-finger long-press gesture. This gesture triggers a UIAlert asking the user what went wrong. When the user enters this information, an email bug report is generated complete with an attached app screenshot and a text file containing the last 2000 logs. Screenshots are created and stored within Aardvark and do not require camera roll access.

### [EditorConfig-Xcode](https://github.com/MarcoSero/EditorConfig-Xcode)

Xcode plugin that integrates with [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) to provide a portable and configurable indentation settings

### [XCDLumberjackNSLogger](https://github.com/0xced/XCDLumberjackNSLogger)

A [CocoaLumberjack](https://github.com/CocoaLumberjack/CocoaLumberjack) logger which sends logs to [NSLogger](https://github.com/fpillet/NSLogger).

# Trending Objective-C projects

### [JSPatch](https://github.com/bang590/JSPatch)

Library to call Objective-C classes from Javascript code. Kudos for the effort, but was it really necessary?

### [SimpleTouchID](https://github.com/liu044100/SmileTouchID)

Wrapper around TouchID APIs.

### [EmptyDataSet](https://github.com/dzenbot/DZNEmptyDataSet)

Category on UITableView and UICollectionView to handle the empty state in an elegant way.

### [MMBarricade](https://github.com/mutualmobile/MMBarricade) 

Add a run-time local server to intercept request made by the app.

### [ios-flexboxkit](https://github.com/alexdrone/ios-flexboxkit) 

`UIView` that allows configuring it's subviews in a [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) way.
