Howdy! Hope you have a relaxing weekend, because this week we have plenty of new projects to dig into 😁

## [Static](https://github.com/venmo/Static)

**Language: Swift**

How many times have you written static table view code? How many time have you screamed in frustration seeing some old `swicth` statement done on the `section`s and `row`s? Dread no more, this Swfit framework by [Venmo](https://venmo.com/) provides an easy and clean API to clearly define static table views, once and for all.

```swift
let dataSource = TableDataSource()
dataSource.sections = [
  Section(header: "Money", rows: [
      Row(text: "Balance", detailText: "$12.00", accessory: .DisclosureIndicator, selection: {
          // Show statement
      }),
      Row(text: "Transfer to Bank…", cellClass: ButtonCell.self, selection: {
          // Show transfer to bank modal
      })
  ], footer: "Transfers usually arrive within 1-3 business days.")
]

dataSource.tableView = tableView
```

## [Chameleon](https://github.com/ViccAlexander/Chameleon)

**Language: Objective-C** (and Swift)

Chameleon is a remarkable flat colors framework for iOS, packed of features. Not only it comes with gorgeous colors, and color schemes, but also gradients, Storyboard palette, and great Quick Help documentation.

## [Bond](https://github.com/SwiftBond/Bond)

**Language: Swift**

Bond is a Swift binding framework that takes binding concept to a whole new level - boils it down to just one operator. It's simple, powerful, type-safe and multi-paradigm.

With Bond you can do things like:

```swift
viewModel.numberOfFollowers.map { "\($0)" } ->> label
```

or

```swift
lazy var loginButtonTapListener = Bond<UIControlEvents>() { event in
  // perform login
}

loginButton.dynEvent.filter(==, .TouchUpInside) ->> loginButtonTapListener
```

If the code above looks cryptical to you, have a read to the "[Functional concepts explained](https://github.com/SwiftBond/Bond#functional-concepts-explained)" section of the README.

## [DOFavoriteButton](https://github.com/okmr-d/DOFavoriteButton)

**Language: Swift**

![DOFavoriteButton](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okmr-d/okmr-d.github.io/master/img/DOFavoriteButton/demo.gif)

This components allows you to add a cute selection animation to any kind of _flat_ image. It is fullyg configurable via both Interface Builder and code. Head over to the [README's how to use](https://github.com/okmr-d/DOFavoriteButton#how-to-use) section to find out its full potential.

## [SwiftGen](https://github.com/AliSoftware/SwiftGen)

**Language: Swift**

From the makers of the great [OHHTTPStubs](https://github.com/AliSoftware/OHHTTPStubs) comes a collection of tools to auto-generate Swift code for various assests in the project.

At the moment you can generate:

* `enums` for your Assets Catalogs
* `enums` for your UIStoryboard and their Scenes
* `enums` for your UIColors.
* `enums` for your Localizable.strings strings.

## [iOS 9 Day by Day](https://github.com/shinobicontrols/iOS9-day-by-day)

**Language: Swift**

Every year [Shinobi Controls](https://www.shinobicontrols.com) releases a series of tutorials on the newest iOS SDK features. The first two in the series cover the new search API, and UI testing. Definitely keep an eye on this one.

## [ParkedTextField](https://github.com/gmertk/ParkedTextField)

A text field with a constant text/placeholder. That's it.

_Note: as the author declares in the README, the main functionality works, but the library is still under development._

## [Mirror](https://github.com/kostiakoval/Mirror)

**Language: Swift**

Mirror is a library to add reflection to Swift's objects. 100% Swift, no Objective-C runtime.

```swift
struct Person {
  let name: String
  var age: Int
}

var person = Person(name: "Jon", age: 27)
let mirror = Mirror(person)

mirror.name
//"MirrorTest.Person"

mirror.memorySize
// 32

mirror.isClass
//false

mirror.isStruct
//true

mirror.names
//["name", "age"]

mirror.values
//["Jon", 27]

mirror.types
//[Swift.String, Swift.Int]
```
