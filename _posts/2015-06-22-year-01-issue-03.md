What's interesting about this week's projects the visible impact of the announcements from WWDC. We have tools written in Swift 2.0, as well as port of new components like `UIStackView` to iOS versions lower than 9.

Let's dig in!

# Trending Swift projects

### [WeatherMap](https://github.com/TakeFiveInteractive/WeatherMap)

It is always nice to see real world app, [available on the App Store]() open sourced, and look at the architectural decisions that their authors have made.

### [PageMenu](https://github.com/uacaps/PageMenu)

A fully customizable and flexible paging menu controller built from other view controllers placed inside a scroll view allowing the user to switch between any kind of view controller with an easy tap or swipe gesture. This project is remarkable for the degree of customization that is seems to have, something that is rare to find in UI libraries.

The dependency manager written in Swift that doesn't touch your project has been updated to version 0.7.5, adding support for watchOS.


# New Swift projects

Venmo has been releasing a lot of cool open source projects recently, and [DVR](https://github.com/venmo/DVR) is their latest one. With DVR you can record and repaly `NSURLSession` requests, and use them for example in an acceptance test suite. It is inspired by [vcr](https://github.com/vcr/vcr).

### [Playdown](https://github.com/matthewpalmer/Playdown)

A script to convert Playground files into [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) ones.

}

var myInt: Box<Int>(5)
myInt += 37
```

# Trending Objective-C projects

### [DWURecyclingAlert](https://github.com/diwu/DWURecyclingAlert)

_This library made it to the list last week as well, and very well deserving it. A very useful tool indeed._

A drop-in code snippet that detects non-recycled UI elements inside your `UITableViewCells`, and marks them in red. Very useful while developing, and itâ€™s disabled in Release builds by default.

# New Objective-C projects

### [Dixie](https://github.com/Skyscanner/Dixie)

Probably one of the most interesting projects in this week's issue, Dixie is an open source Objective-C testing framework for altering object behaviours. It's primary goal is to provide a set of tools, which the developers can test their code with. Behind the goal is the ideology of "do not always expect the best". You can read more about Dixie [here](https://medium.com/@TeamDistinction/dixie-turning-chaos-to-your-advantage-b1ffd9bd5165).

### [OALayoutAnchor](https://github.com/oarrabi/OALayoutAnchor)

From the same author of [OAStackView](https://github.com/oarrabi/OAStackView), here's a port of iOS 9's new [`NSLayoutAnchor`](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/AppKit/Reference/NSLayoutAnchor_ClassReference/index.html).

### [NSString-Hash](https://github.com/liufan321/NSString-Hash)

### [Follower](https://github.com/mamaral/Follower)

A library to "_track trip distance, speed, altitude, and duration like a boss._".

```objc
/ Create your follower, and tell it to start route tracking.
self.follower = [Follower new];
[self.follower beginRouteTracking];

// Maybe they want to pause their workout so they can stop for a drink...
[self.follower pauseRouteTracking]

// Ready to get back to it!
[self.follower resumeRouteTracking]

// Some time later when they're done...
[self.follower endRouteTracking];

// Then query the follower instance like this
[self.follower averageSpeedWithUnit:SpeedUnitKilometersPerHour];
[self.follower totalDistanceWithUnit:DistanceUnitKilometers];
...
```
