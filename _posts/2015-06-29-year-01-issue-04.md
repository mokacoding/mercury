Many interesting new projects this week, but also some from the past ones. Also notable news: [CocoaPods 0.38.0.beta.1](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0380beta1) has been released.

Let's get started!

# Trending Swift projects

### [ios-universal-webview-boilerplate](https://github.com/nabilfreeman/ios-universal-webview-boilerplate)

A Xcode 6 Universal project that allows you to wrap your website or web app in a super simple iOS app, so you can build apps in HTML/CSS/JS without using Cordova.

I am personally an advocate of native development, but it is arguable that there are many scenarios in which at least starting with a web app is a better choice. If you find yourself in such a position have a look at this project.

### [ios-charts](https://github.com/danielgindi/ios-charts)

A port of the [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) Android chart library to iOS. This library features many good looking types of charts, all with a number of configurations.

### [BubbleTransition](https://github.com/andreamazz/BubbleTransition)

A custom modal transition that presents and dismiss a controller inside an expanding and shrinking bubble.

### [Stick-Hero-Swift](https://github.com/phpmaple/Stick-Hero-Swift)

An universal game written in Swift 2 and using SpriteKit. And if you are into games have a look at [BallSwift](https://github.com/FancyPixel/BallSwift) which showcases the new additions to `UIDynamics` in iOS 9.

### [DVR](https://github.com/venmo/DVR)

DVR is a simple Swift framework for making fake `NSURLSession` requests. It is inspired by [vcr](https://github.com/vcr/vcr).

# New Swift projects

### [DPTheme](https://github.com/dphans/DPTheme)

A single point of configuration for your app's colors. Add this to the `AppDelegate`'s `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`

```swift
var mainColor: UIColor = ...
var secondColor: UIColor = ...
let fontName = "Avenir"

DPTheme.setupTheme(
  mainColor,
  secondaryColor: secondColor,
  fontName: fontName,
  lightStatusBar: true)
```

### [ExpandingStackCells](https://github.com/jozsef-vesza/ExpandingStackCells)

A take to the task of expanding table cells using iOS 9's new `UIStackView`.

### [replete](https://github.com/mfikes/replete)

[ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) REPL iOS app.

# Trending Objective-C projects

### [Tropos](https://github.com/thoughtbot/Tropos)

If an agency like [Thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/) open sources an app, you might want to have a look at it. Especially in this case, Tropos does large use of [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa) and MVVM, there is a lot to learn looking at this source code.

### [Bohr](https://github.com/DavdRoman/Bohr)

Bohr allows you to set up a settings screen for your app with three principles in mind: ease, customization and extensibility.

The layout of a settings screen made with Bohr can be defined from Storyboards, and there are many parameters that can be customised when [subclassing the framework table view cell](https://github.com/DavdRoman/Bohr#subclassing-botableviewcell).

### [Valet](https://github.com/square/Valet)

Valet lets you securely store data in the iOS or OS X Keychain, and aims to remove the need to understand how the Keychain works.

### [DTRichTextEditor](https://github.com/Cocoanetics/DTRichTextEditor)

A replacement for _Apple's severally limited_ `UITextView`, that allows editing of attributed strings. A notable thing is that this project is actually a combination of other four open source libraries.

### [OAStackView](https://github.com/oarrabi/OAStackView)

A port of the new iOS 9 [`UIStackView`](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIStackView_Class_Reference/) to iOS 6+.

# New Objective-C projects

### [ShowKeys](https://github.com/jmhobbs/ShowKeys)

Simple OSX app to allow display of pressed keys. Great for screencasts. Have a look at the demo video [here](http://dropitvc.herokuapp.com/u/MjY0AitRCA).
